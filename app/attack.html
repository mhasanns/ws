<p>Similar to frequent CSRF attack scenarios, WebSocket connections are sometimes only validated by checking whether the user has a valid<br>
session token or not, instead of making sure that there's an authenticity token sent along with the request, or a valid value for the Origin header.<br>
In this scenario, the server only checks if the request is eligible to continue the handshake process or not by checking whether there's a valid session token in the upgrading request or not.<br>Unlike all the other CSRF cases, WebSocket connections are NOT subject to the Same Origin Policy (SOP), nor<br>
Cross Site Resource Sharing (CORS) rules, which gives the attacker not only the ability to issue blind requests, but to also read responses.<br>
Click "Handshake" to start a handshake with the "Secret" app, an alert box will show up confirming the handshake.<br>
Then click "Show Secret" to issue a WebSocket request that retreives the secret message from the server.<br>
This is where the CSRF-like behavior appears, but with the ability to read the response.</p>
